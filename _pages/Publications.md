- [Paper Link](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/352934838_BEAT_ESTIMATION_FROM_MUSICIAN_VISUAL_CUES)
<p style="text-align:justify"> This paper aims to discover a robust technique that can identify musical phases (beats) through
visual cues derived from a musician’s body movements captured through camera sensors.A multi-instrumental
dataset was used to carry out a comparative study of two different approaches: (a) motiongram, and (b) pose estimation, 
to detect phase from body sway. </p>
