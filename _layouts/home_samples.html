<!-- Welcome! I am a doctoral candidate in the Joint Program in Social Work and Sociology at the University of Michigan. In the broadest sense, my research interests organizational theory, gender, and social problem construction. My dissertation, which focuses on the relationship between the social service systems for intimate partner violence (IPV) and alcohol and other drug use (AOD), is a mixed-methods exploration of why so few organizations provide services both issues, despite their co-occurrence at the individual level. Through comparing organizations providing hybrid IPV-AOD services with non-hybrid IPV and AOD organizations, my dissertation identifies policies, organizational characteristics, and practices conducive to the provision of services for both issues.

I have recently moved to the Department of Statistics, University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign as an Assistant Professor. Please visit my Illinois website here: publish.illinois.edu/naveen . I obtained my PhD at the Department of Statistics, University of Michigan under the guidance of Prof. Xuming He and Prof. Vijay Nair . Prior to that I pursued my Bachelors and Masters degrees in Statistics from Indian Statistical Institute, Kolkata. My research interests include High Dimensional Data, Variable Selection, Bayesian Computation, Large-Scale Computational Models, Functional Data Analysis, Censored Data  and Quantile-Based Inference. I am also passionate about teaching and I aspire to be a faculty in the future to be able to do both research and teaching. One of the most rewarding experiences for me to be in Statistics is the opportunity to collaborate and learn from scientists from other disciplines including Biology, Medicine, Atmospheric and Climate sciences.
