Hello! I'm Senem, a passionate Artificial Intelligence Engineer with 3 years of industry experience. I obtained my Master degree in Artificial 
Intelligence (AI) (2024), I hold a Bachelor in Computer Engineering. I specialize in Computer Vision, with a particular focus on tracking. 
I have experience on activity recognition, pose estimation, Natural Language Processing. <br>
  
<!-- My expertise lies in enhancing products using AI, focusing on computer vision and image processing. However, I am also intrigued 
by Natural Language Processing and dedicate some of my free time to exploring its possibilities. 
  
I often dedicate part of my free time to experimenting with the latest methods, tools, and frameworks in the field when I get 
the chance. To date, I have contributed to various projects, frequently publishing results in peer-reviewed proceedings 
and conferences dedicated to Computer Vision, Image Processing, NLP. Many of these works have centered on improving
traditional tasks such  as classification, sentiment analysis and feature extraction, employing varios and modern techniques like Deep 
Convoulutional Neural Networks, Pose Estimations, Word embeddings. All in all, my goal remains to stay on top of the latest advancements 
and share insights through active participation. -->
