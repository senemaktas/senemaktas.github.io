<h2> About Me </h2>

<p align="justify"> My name is Senem ðŸ‘‹. I am a computer engineer who wants to improve herself in the field of data science.
I would like to describe myself as a GNU / Linux lover. penguin :penguin: Since the field of data science is a wide field, 
I would like to study in this field because I will always have a lot to learn. :bar_chart: One of my goals is to contribute 
mathematically and statistically to this area. During my engineering education, I took courses on C, C #, Java, Python and R
programming languages. So I'm familiar with these languages. I am currently continuing with Python.  On my page, I share the 
links of my articles I published on Medium and my projects. As a hobby, I enjoy creating websites and reading books. </p>
