<h3> About Me </h3>

<p style="text-align:justify"> <small>   
Hello! I'm Senem, a passionate Artificial Intelligence Engineer with 2+ years of experience. Currently pursuing a Master's in AI,
I hold a BSc in Computer Engineering. My expertise lies in enhancing products using AI, focusing on computer vision and
image processing. However, I am also intrigued by Natural Language Processing and dedicate some of my free time to exploring its possibilities. <br>
  
I often dedicate part of my free time to experimenting with the latest methods, tools, and frameworks in the field when I get 
the chance. To date, I have contributed to various projects, frequently publishing results in peer-reviewed proceedings 
and conferences dedicated to Computer Vision, Image Processing, NLP. Many of these works have centered on improving
traditional tasks such  as classification, sentiment analysis and feature extraction, employing varios and modern techniques like Deep 
Convoulutional Neural Networks, Pose Estimations, Word embeddings. All in all, my goal remains to stay on top of the latest advancements 
and share insights through active participation. </p>

<h2> Ongoing Projects </h2>

- Video Face Forgery Detection (Master Thesis) <br>
- Smart Monitoring of Human Motion and Activities in the Production Environment
