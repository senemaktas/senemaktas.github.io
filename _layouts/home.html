<h3> About Me </h3>

<p style="text-align:justify"> <small>   Hi, I am Senem ðŸ‘‹. I am an Artificial Intelligence Engineer over 2 years of experience.
  I am persuding Artificial Intelligence Master degree in 2024. I have BSc Computer Engineering background. 
  
  In my current capacity as an  Artificial Intelligence Engineer my primary focus lies in enhancing various products such as 
  Activity/Action Recognition and Health and Safety (EHS) by implementing AI solutions primarily based on computer vision 
  and image processing. As I progress towards attaining my Master's Degree in Artificial Intelligence, I continue to enhance 
  my skills and knowledge in areas that complement those two core components, including Deep Learning methods.
  
  While computer vision and image processing form the basis of my professional experience, I cannot help but feel drawn to the 
  captivating realm of Natural Language Processing. Despite it being a secondary area of mine, I often dedicate part of my free time 
  to experimenting with the latest methods, tools, and frameworks in the field when I get the chance. To date, I have contributed to
  various projects, frequently publishing results in peer-reviewed proceedings and conferences dedicated to Computer Vision, Image 
  Processing, Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning. Many of these works have centered on improving traditional tasks such 
  as classification, sentiment analysis and feature extraction, employing varios and modern techniques like Deep Convoulutional Neural
  Networks, Pose Estimations, Word embeddings. All in all, my goal remains to stay on top of the latest advancements and share insights
  through active participation. </p>
